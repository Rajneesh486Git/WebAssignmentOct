## Portfolio

I'm a all around programmer, both being able to code back-end ssweel as front-end. I often code in C# on the back-end side and I have some knownledge about SQl and database structuring. Front-end side, I usually code HTML5, CSS3 and only some JavaScript. During my time (2 years) when programming I have used git to sync and work togheter with small teams, more specific, Github for that.
