    <h2>About page</h2>

    <p>
    I'm a all around programmer, both being able to code back-end ssweel as front-end. 
    I often code in C# on the back-end side and I have some knownledge about SQl and database structuring. 
    Front-end side, I usually code HTML5, CSS3 and only some JavaScript. 
    During my time, 2 years of programming I have used git to sync and work togheter with small teams, more specific, Github for that.
